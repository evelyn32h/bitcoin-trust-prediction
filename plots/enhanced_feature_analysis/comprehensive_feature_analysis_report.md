# Comprehensive Feature Analysis Report

Generated following the specific workflow requirements for feature analysis

## Feature Plots Generated

### MAIN FEATURE PLOTS (As Required):
1. **Individual Feature Distributions** - Each feature analyzed separately
2. **Embeddedness Filtering Feature Impact** - Before/after filtering comparison
3. **Weighted vs Unweighted Feature Comparison** - Explaining performance differences
4. **Feature Statistics Analysis** - Skewness, kurtosis, mean, std for each feature

### ADDITIONAL FEATURE PLOTS:
5. **Enhanced Scaler Comparison** - Best preprocessing method recommendation
6. **Class Distribution Analysis** - Edge label distribution across conditions

## Key Findings

### Embeddedness Filtering Impact on Features

- **Edge reduction**: 31.5%
- **Feature distribution**: Significantly altered by filtering
- **Impact**: Changes feature characteristics and separability

### Why Weighted Features Underperform

- **Variance ratio**: 34746.77x higher for weighted features
- **Problem**: Higher variance increases overfitting risk
- **Solution**: Binary features provide better stability
- **Conclusion**: Simple sign-based features optimal for HOC analysis

### Preprocessing Recommendation

- **Recommended scaler**: MinMaxScaler
- **Basis**: Best distribution normalization (lowest skewness + kurtosis)
- **Benefits**: Optimal feature preprocessing for model training
