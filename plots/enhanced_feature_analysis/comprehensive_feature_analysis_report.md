# Comprehensive Feature Analysis Report

Enhanced version with improved naming and colors following workflow requirements

## Feature Plots Generated

### MAIN FEATURE PLOTS (6 types with improvements):
1. **Individual Feature Distributions** - Improved naming (Feature 1,2,3... or 3-cycle A,B,C + 4-cycle A,B,C,D,E,F)
2. **Embeddedness Filtering Feature Impact** - Improved colors in top-left plot for better visibility
3. **Weighted vs Unweighted Feature Comparison** - Explaining performance differences
4. **Feature Statistics Analysis** - Skewness, kurtosis, mean, std for each feature
5. **Enhanced Scaler Comparison** - Best preprocessing method recommendation
6. **Class Distribution Analysis** - Edge label distribution across conditions

## Key Improvements Made

### Feature Naming Improvements:
-  **Changed from inaccurate HOC names to clear indexing**
- **Option 1**: Feature 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, etc. (simple indexing)
- **Option 2**: 3-cycle A, B, C + 4-cycle A, B, C, D, E, F (cycle-based)
- **Automatic selection** based on feature count and cycle length

### Color Improvements:
- **Embeddedness filtering plot (top-left)**: Changed to distinct colors
- **Dark blue vs Dark orange** instead of similar light colors
- **Added outline and filled versions** for better contrast
- **Improved visibility** for comparing filtered vs unfiltered distributions

## Key Findings

### Embeddedness Filtering Impact on Features

- **Edge reduction**: 31.5%
- **Feature distribution**: Significantly altered by filtering
- **Impact**: Changes feature characteristics and separability
- **Visualization**: Now uses improved colors for better visibility

### Why Weighted Features Underperform

- **Variance ratio**: 34746.77x higher for weighted features
- **Problem**: Higher variance increases overfitting risk
- **Solution**: Binary features provide better stability
- **Conclusion**: Simple sign-based features optimal for HOC analysis

### Preprocessing Recommendation

- **Recommended scaler**: MinMaxScaler
- **Basis**: Best distribution normalization (lowest skewness + kurtosis)
- **Benefits**: Optimal feature preprocessing for model training
