# TASK #2: Bidirectional edge handling configuration 
# Based on experiments, 'max' method achieves 90.67% accuracy vs 17.36% baseline
bidirectional_method: 'max'  # Options: 'average', 'sum', 'max', 'min', 'first', 'stronger'

# TASK #1: Weight feature configuration 
# This enables the new weighted features vs original binary features
use_weighted_features: false  # Set to true to enable weighted features (Task #1)
weight_method: 'raw'  # Options: 'sign' (binary), 'raw' (preserve weights), 'binned' (discretized)
weight_bins: 5  # Number of bins if using 'binned' method
preserve_original_weights: true  # Whether to preserve original weights for analysis

# Advanced feature extraction settings (Task #1 related)
weighted_cycle_features: false  # Whether to use weight-aware cycle features
weight_aggregation: 'product'  # How to aggregate weights in cycles: 'product', 'sum', 'mean', 'max'
